# Oh!, I didn't see you. Let me introduce myself :cowboy_hat_face:
My name is ***Sergio Gutierrez*** 🙋‍♂️, but you can call me Seth, Sergio, or even _Seezly_ if you want it to. I'm a ***designer*** and ***front-end developer*** (__soon a full-stack!__). I like to *solve problems* ⌨️, find *new challenges* 🤔, *think big* 💭 and, *eat pizza* :pizza:.

In my free time 🕛, I like to either think about *what kind of project I will do*, *design* the project itself or *code* it once for all! (I also watch a lot of anime and read manga, you can dm me with a recommendation!)

Technologies I use the most 💖:

- HTML
- CSS (SCSS)
- JavaScript
- React
- Node.js
- PHP
- MySQL
- Git

I also have knowledge in ❤️:

- Bootstrap
- Materialize CSS
- jQuery
- Python
- Typescript
- Express
- SocketIO

And I'm currently learning 💘:

- MongoDB
