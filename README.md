# Oh!, I didn't see you. Let me introduce myself :cowboy_hat_face:
My name is ***Sergio Gutierrez*** 🙋‍♂️, but you can call me Seth, Sergio, or even _Seezly_ if you want it to. I'm an attempt of ***designer*** and ***front-end developer*** (__soon an attempt of full-stack!__). I like to *solve problems* ⌨️, find *new challenges* 🤔, *think big* 💭 and, *eat pizza* :pizza:.

In my free time 🕛, I like to either think about *what kind of project I will do* or *design* the project itself or *code* it once for all!

Technologies I use the most 💖:

- HTML
- CSS (*SCSS*)
- JavaScript
- MySQL

I also have knowlegde in ❤️:

- Bootstrap
- Materialize CSS
- JQuery
- Python ~~(Just the basics)~~
- PHP ~~(Just the basics)~~

And I'd like to learn these 💘:

- React
- Redux
- Next.js
- Angular
- Vue.js
- Node.js
- MongoDB
- PostgreSQL
- Express.js
