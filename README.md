# Oh!, I didn't see you. Let me introduce myself :cowboy_hat_face:
My name is ***Sergio Gutierrez***, but you can call me Seth, Sergio, or even _Seezly_ if you want it to. I'm an attempt of ***designer*** and ***front-end developer*** (__soon an attempt of full-stack!__). I like to *solve problems*, find *new challenges*, *think big* and, *eat pizza*.

In my free time, I like to either think about *what kind of project I will do* or *design* the project itself or *code* it once for all!

Technologies I use the most:

- HTML
- CSS (*SCSS*)
- JavaScript
- MySQL

I also have knowlegde in:

- Bootstrap
- Materialize CSS
- JQuery
- Python ~~(Just the basics)~~
- PHP ~~(Just the basics)~~
